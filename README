EPiServer Module Project

Small project I use as a starting point to create EPiServer Modules that can be simply used to plug into an existing install of EPiServer.

Project includes (to make life somewhat easier): 

- PageType Builder
- SubSonic 

/Releases Folder

This contains the files that need just be copy and pasted into the root of an existing EPiServer Site.
